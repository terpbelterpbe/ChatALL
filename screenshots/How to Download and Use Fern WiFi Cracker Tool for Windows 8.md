In this section, we will show you a step-by-step guide on how to crack a WEP encrypted wireless network using Fern WiFi Cracker tool for Windows 8. WEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy and it is a security protocol that was used to protect wireless networks in the past. However, WEP is very weak and can be easily cracked by various methods. Therefore, you should avoid using WEP and switch to a more secure protocol such as WPA or WPA2.
 
To crack a WEP encrypted wireless network using Fern WiFi Cracker tool for Windows 8, you need to follow these steps:

1. Run Fern WiFi Cracker as an administrator and click on the "Scan for Access Points" button on the top left corner. This will scan for all the available wireless networks in your range and display them in a list.
2. Select the network that you want to crack by clicking on it. Make sure that the encryption type is WEP and that the signal strength is good. You can also see the MAC address, channel number and vendor name of the network.
3. Click on the "Attack" button on the top right corner and select "WEP Attack (ARP Request Replay)" from the drop-down menu. This will start the attack process and try to capture enough data packets to crack the WEP key.
4. Wait for some time until you see a message that says "Key Found" and shows you the WEP key in hexadecimal format. You can also see the number of IVs (Initialization Vectors) captured and the cracking speed.
5. Copy the WEP key and use it to connect to the wireless network. You have successfully cracked the WEP encryption and gained access to the network.

Congratulations! You have learned how to crack a WEP encrypted wireless network using Fern WiFi Cracker tool for Windows 8. However, remember that this is only for educational purposes and not for illegal activities. You should respect the privacy and security of other users and networks.
