Kosala Novel Summary and Analysis:
 
Kosala is not a conventional novel with a linear plot and well-defined characters. It is more like a collage of impressions, memories, reflections and emotions of the narrator, Pandurang Sangvikar. The novel does not follow a chronological order, but jumps back and forth in time, sometimes without any clear transition. The novel also does not have any clear climax or resolution, but ends abruptly with Pandurang's decision to withdraw from the world.
 
The novel can be seen as an exploration of Pandurang's existential crisis, as he struggles to find meaning and purpose in his life. He is dissatisfied with his rural background, his family, his education, his friends and his society. He feels alienated from his own culture and tradition, as well as from the modern and westernized world. He is unable to form any lasting or meaningful relationships with anyone, including women. He is constantly tormented by doubts, fears, anxieties and guilt. He is also haunted by the death of his sister Mani, who was his only source of love and affection.
 
The novel also portrays the social and cultural changes that took place in India in the 1950s and 1960s, especially in Maharashtra. The novel depicts the contrast between the rural and urban life, the traditional and modern values, the conservative and progressive attitudes, the caste and class divisions, the religious and political conflicts and the linguistic and regional differences. The novel also reflects the influence of western literature, philosophy and psychology on the young generation of India.
